Constructivism as Intervention
==============================
* Constructivism was developed by Piaget
* Constructivism is knowledge is not transmitted, but constructed
* In constructivism, individual must reconstruct knowledge in a material environment
* Constructionism was developed by Papert 
* Constructionism is active making of something outside of one’s head; tangible, shareable
* Constructionism is learning by making
* Papert thought constructivism has a disassociation of knowledge without context
* Papert thought this disassociation would cause weaker understanding

========================================================================
Piaget’s Constructivism, Papert’s Constrctionism: What’s the difference?
========================================================================
* For both Piaget & Papert, knowledge is constructed through interaction with the world
* Piaget - framework for understanding children’s way of thinking at development levels
* Piaget - children have worldview that differ from adults
* Piaget - children’s worldview are coherent and robust
* Piaget - “logic” of worldview suits their current needs and possibilities
* Piaget - for a child to change worldview they need more than exposure to better view
* Piaget - child’s actions or experiences will cause them to change worldview
* Piaget - teaching is indirect: have to interpret what they hear
* Piaget - Transmission model won’t work: knowledge acquired through interaction
* Piaget - Acknowledge resistance to learning: kids have good reasons not to change view
* Piaget overlooks context, uses, media, and importance of individual preferences 
* Papert - builds on Piaget, but wants engaged learner constructing public entity
* Papert - helps us to understand how ideas get formed and transformed through media
* Papert - moves from universals to individual learns’ conversation with favorite media
* Papert - projecting our inner feelings and ideas is key to learning
* Papert - expressing ideas makes them tangible and shareable, this sharpens these ideas
* Papert - self-directed learning is iterative process, invent tools for learning
* Constructionism are more situated and pragmatic than Constructivism
* Situated learning means knowledge shouldn’t be detached from situations in which it is constructed and actualized
* Papert - constructionism is just as important as general, impersonal, abstract thinking
* Piaget - kids become progressively detached from world of concrete objects, gradually becoming able to mentally manipulate symbolic objects within a realm of hypothetical worlds
* Papert - becoming one with the phenomenon under study is a key to learning
* Papert - focus on how knowledge is formed/transformed within specific contexts
* Papert - advocates diving into unknown situations at the cost of experiencing a moment sense of loss is a crucial part of learning

=========================
Situating Constructionism
=========================
* everything is to be understood by being constructed
* constructionism touches on the nature of knowledge and the nature of knowing
